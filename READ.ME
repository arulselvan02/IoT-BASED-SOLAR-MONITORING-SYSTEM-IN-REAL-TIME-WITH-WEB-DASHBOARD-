# IoT-Based Solar Monitoring System

This project monitors solar panel voltage, current, and power in real-time using Arduino and ESP32, displaying the data on both an LCD and a web dashboard.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- ESP32
- Voltage Sensor
- Current Sensor (e.g., ACS712)
- LCD Display (I2C 16x2)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## 📁 Project Structure

- `arduino_code.ino`: Arduino code for reading voltage and current, calculating power, and displaying on LCD. Sends data to ESP32 via serial.
- `wifi_code.ino`: ESP32 code that connects to Wi-Fi, reads serial data from Arduino, and displays it on a web page.

## 📡 How It Works

1. Arduino reads analog voltage and current sensor values.
2. Calculates power from the readings.
3. Displays the data on an LCD screen.
4. Sends the data over Serial to ESP32.
5. ESP32 hosts a web server and displays the received data in real-time.

## 🌐 Web Dashboard Features

- Displays current Voltage, Current, and Power values.
- Shows Max values for reference.
- Refresh button to reload real-time data.
- Styled HTML for a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Upload `arduino_code.ino` to your Arduino Uno.
2. Upload `wifi_code.ino` to your ESP32 (set correct RX/TX pins).
3. Connect both devices properly with sensors and LCD.
4. Power up both devices.
5. Connect to the same Wi-Fi and visit ESP32's IP on browser.
